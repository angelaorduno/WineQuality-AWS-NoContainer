The assignment for this week has two main objectives: 1) to reinforce understanding and application of container technology; and 2) to build, train, test, and deploy ML projects on the AWS cloud using Amazon SageMaker with and without container technology.

This assignment uses the Wine Quality Dataset at the UCI repository: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/wine+quality. The model will predict the wine quality, which has a score between 0 and 10 from the 11 given features:
1 - fixed acidity 2 - volatile acidity 3 - citric acid 4 - residual sugar 5 - chlorides 6 - free sulfur dioxide 7 - total sulfur dioxide 8 - density 9 - pH 10 - sulfates 11 - alcohol

Build the model for predicting the wine quality. Containerize the model and deploy it on Heroku.

Use linear regression to repeat problem 1 in two different ways on the AWS SageMaker studio Lab as follows:

a) Without container technology. The objective is to code and build an ML project in AWS SageMaker.

b) With container technology using. The objective is to use the container technology in SageMaker o build the project.

Instructions

For problem 1, submit the Notebook on GitHub and the Heroku URL of your application.

For problem 2, submit a notebook on GitHub (parts a and b can be completed on the same Notebook as the Iris example project covered in this module).

If your solution (application) is not working properly, submit all error logs and describe the actions you took to troubleshoot the error.
